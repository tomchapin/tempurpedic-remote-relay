# Tempurpedic Remote Relay

This is an experimental hobbyist project, where the goal was to interface my adjustable Tempurpedic Ergo Adjustable Bed
with my home automation system and with my Amazon Echo. Specifically, I wanted to use the bed's "vibrate"
feature as an alarm clock in the morning, however, I figured I might as well wire up all of the other buttons
on the remote, too!

This project was inspired by the one found here:
